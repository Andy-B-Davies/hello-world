# hello-world
My first repository

Hi. I'm Andy and I want to learn to be a developer. I'm new to programming. I studied Maths and did some coding in matlab, maple etc. I've since learned the basics of c++,c# and have been playing around with some Unity3d tutorials, as I have always wanted to make a game.
